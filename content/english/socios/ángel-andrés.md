Hello, I'm Ángel, a technology professional with a focus on hardware and innovation. I currently serve as the CTO at Kenso Solutions, where I lead hardware development projects.

My career in technology has been diverse. I've explored entrepreneurship as a co-founder of Fum Blau Innovació, where we developed innovative solutions. Prior to that, I worked as a technician at SIRIUS PROTOTYPES, gaining hands-on experience with various prototypes.

My expertise includes hardware development, C++ programming, and data analysis using Excel. I enjoy the process of product development and seeing ideas come to fruition.

I'm open to discussions about hardware development, product innovation, or C++ programming. Feel free to reach out if you're interested in talking about technology or potential collaborations.
