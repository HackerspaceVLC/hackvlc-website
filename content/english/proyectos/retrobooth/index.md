## Quick Start
- **Repository**: [GitHub - RetroBooth](https://github.com/HackerspaceVLC/retrobooth)
- **Current Status**: Project completed, in documentation phase
- **Key Feature**: NFC-based filter selection with Polaroid-style reveal
- **Privacy**: Photos automatically deleted after printing

## Overview
RetroBooth modernizes the classic photo booth experience by combining vintage aesthetics with contemporary technology. Users select filters using physical NFC cards, creating an interactive and tactile experience. Following the Polaroid philosophy, photos remain hidden until printing, adding an element of anticipation and surprise.
